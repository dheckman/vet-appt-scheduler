# What was used
I used a combination of Typescript/SCSS Modules, as well as the [https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar](React Big Calendar library). It's well supported, releases often, and a fairly minimal (uses flexbox and supports IE10+).

With more time, I would probably use some type of CSS in JS library (Linaria).
